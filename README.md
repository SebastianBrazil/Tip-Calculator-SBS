4/1/24 pt1: Made the basic layout for the page and its elements. Styling and sizing are still needed.
4/1/24 pt2: Decided to temporarily suspend styling to work on logic. It is, in all effect, done, but some formatting with zeros is still needed.
4/2/24 pt1: Added some more logic which formats zeros, but that is practically styling. As of now the logic is completely complete, with styling being the next goal.
4/2/24 pt2: Added a lot of desktop styling as well as made some logic modifications. Responsiveness, hovers and active states, and some more desktop styling are still needed.
4/2/24 pt3: All of the styling is done, the next thing to work on is the hover and focus states.
4/3/24 pt1: Finished all of the hovers and focus states, with some more logic sprinkled in. Finally mobile can commence.
